Coming off the back of my previous post on how to create a fibonacci generator in assembly language, I realised there are a few shortcomings of it that could be rectified. In this post I will go through some if the ways to improve an assembly application including:

- making an application modular for reuse and extensibility
- testing of components
- extending to 64-bit for larger numbers
- switching in a new algorithm of improved time and space O() value complexity
